// Modify your for loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza instead 
// of printing just the name of the pizza. For each pizza you should have one line of output 
// containing a simple statement like I like pepperoni pizza.

// â€¢ Add a line at the end of your program,
//  outside the for loop, that states how much you like pizza.
//   The output should consist of three or more lines about the kinds of pizza you like and then an additional sentence,
//    such as I really love pizza!
