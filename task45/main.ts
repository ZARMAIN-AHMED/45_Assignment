//Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. 
//The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. 
//It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs,
// such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object that’s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly
